# Project Solutions üìÉ

This repository contains solutions to the following GCS-2 Problems for Negpod-1:

## Test :file_folder:

The [test](./test/) directory is a directory that contains automated tests for the shell scripts of each problem in this repository.

## Problem 1 üîç

Write a shell script that will print the strings `one`, `two`, `three`, `four`, and `five` on the screen with each appearing on a separate line. Also, create a text file that has each of these on a separate line and the file name starts with today's date `yyyy-mm-dd-file.txt`. Note: Don‚Äôt add today‚Äôs date manually.

## Solution ‚úÖ

The solution to this problem can be found in the [print_strings](./print_strings) file of this repository. It can be run from the command line as follows:

```sh
user@User:~$ ./print_strings
```
The text file with the strings is also created by this script, and its name starts with the current date in the format `yyyy-mm-dd-file.txt`. For example, if today is `February 15, 2023`, the file name would be `2023-02-15-file.txt`.

## Problem 2 üîç

Write a script that generates two random numbers, and print each of these numbers and their square roots. Then finally print the sum of their square roots on the screen. The expected output is as below

- The first random number generated is `20243`   
- The square root is `142`   
- The second random number generated is `9759`  
- The square root is `98`   
- The sum of their square roots is `240`


## Solution ‚úÖ

The shell script that generates the random numbers and calculates their square roots is called [calculate_square_roots](./calculate_square_roots). It can be run from the command line as follows:

```sh
user@User:~$ ./calculate_square_roots
```
The script will output the two random numbers, their square roots, and the sum of their square roots, as shown in the example in the problem statement.

## Problem 3 üîç

Write a shell script that asks the user to type a phrase, then tells the user the number of words in the phrase and the number of white spaces. The expected output is:

- The number of words is `4`    
- The number of white spaces is `3`

## Solution ‚úÖ

The shell script that asks the user for input and counts the number of words and white spaces is called [count_words_and_spaces](./count_words_and_spaces). It can be run from the command line as follows:

```sh
user@User:~$ ./count_words_and_spaces
```
The script will prompt the user to enter a phrase, and then output the number of words and white spaces in the phrase, as shown in the example in the problem statement.

## Problem 4 üîç

a) Write a shell script that asks the user for two numbers and outputs their products. The expected output should be a statement as such 

```sh
The product of 3 and 3 is 9.
```
b) Suppose you want to create 4 folders. Create a text file with at least 4 words(folder name on each line). Write a shell script that reads each line of the text file. Then creates a corresponding folder for each folder name.

## Solution ‚úÖ

a) The shell script that asks the user for two numbers and ouputs their product is called [product-of_2_numbers](./product-of_2_numbers). It can be run from the command line as follows:

```sh
user@User:~$ ./product-of_2_numbers
```
The script will prompt the user to enter 2 numbers, and then output the product of the 2 numbers, as shown in the example in the problem statement.

b) The shell script that reads each line of a text file [folders.txt](./folders.txt), then creates a corresponding folder for each folder name is called [create-folders](./create-folders). It can be run from the command line as follows:

```sh
user@User:~$ ./create-folders
```
The script will reads each line of the text file [folders.txt](./folders.txt), then creates a corresponding folder for each folder name.

## Problem 5 üîç

Write a shell script that takes a path, and confirms if it is a directory or not. If it is a directory list all files in that directory, if not ask the user to give the file path of a directory.  
- Expected output: List of files in the directory path that was provided

## Solution ‚úÖ

The shell script that checks the path and lists the files is [check-and_list_directory](./check-and_list_directory). It can be run from the command line as follows:

```sh
user@User:~$ ./check-and_list_directory
```
The script will prompt the user to enter a path, and then output a list of files in the directory if it is a directory, or ask the user to enter the path of a directory if it is not a directory, as shown below: 
```sh
teniola@Teniola:~/Group-_gcs-2-$ pwd
/home/teniola/Group-_gcs-2-
teniola@Teniola:~/Group-_gcs-2-$ ./check-and_list_directory
Enter a path: /home/teniola/Group-_gcs-2-
The path you entered is a directory

```

## Problem 6 üîç

Suppose that you want to write the same message to many people except that you want each message personalized with the recipients‚Äô names. This can be achieved using a shell script.

## Solution ‚úÖ

The shell script that creates personalized messages for each recipient is [new-year_message](./new-year_message). It can be run from the command line as follows:

```sh
user@User:~$ ./new-year_message
```
The script will read the text file [names.txt](./names.txt), which is in the same directory as the script, and the message template in [message_template.txt](./message_template.txt). It will then create a personalized message for each recipient in a file named after the recipient. For example, if the recipient's name is `Noella`, the file name would be [Noella.txt](./test/Noella.txt). The message in the file will be personalized with the recipient's name, as shown below:

```sh
user@User:~/Group-_gcs-2-/test$ cat Noella.txt
Happy New Year Noella!
May the coming year be full of grand adventures and opportunities.
```
